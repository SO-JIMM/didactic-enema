# Git Cheatsheet For Create React App

1. Create a repo on Github
   2a. If you make changes to a folder or file, use `git add .`, then use `git commit -m ""`
   2b. If you don't make any changes, and want to 'upload' to your repo, use `git remote add origin https://github.com.git`
2. `git push -u origin master` (you will then be asked for your username and password)
